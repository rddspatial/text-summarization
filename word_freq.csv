Conv_ID,Summary
1,reminds me of earthquake in Sabah not long ago. It's scary when u experience it for the 1st few times! I am feeling an earthquake !!!!!!
2,"Hope it will remain an isolate episode  My first reaction:  I need to save on Google docs that paper I have been editing all day  #priorities Always good to be prepared with five days worth of drinking water, spare everything and healthy snacks, first aid, etc. Just as I was reading about natural disasters, we felt a small #earthquake in Oakland."
3,"It s really REALLY rare to have an earthquake in Florida so that s why I m asking if you guys felt it Yep live in Orlando florida usgs is clearly lying. For the people that live in Orlando,Florida.... apparently there was an earthquake in Florida and I didn t feel it.. did you guys feel it?"
4,Apparently some people in central Florida felt shaking like an earthquake today?
5,"I realize it isn't really weather related, but about 2 hours ago our house shook really hard for about 5 seconds (I'm on the barrier island) and it was felt in Orlando. It felt like a Saturn V launch (not a sonic boom, just the launch). No one is saying what it is and we all felt it on the island from Cocoa Beach down to Indialantic and over to Orlando. I only ask because I did not specifically feel the ground shake."
6,I m pretty sure I felt an earthquake in central Florida this evening.
7,My roommate and I thought we felt an earthquake tonight and through this weird website I found two other people who felt it and turns out we live in the same neighborhood and the working theory is @trvisXX s astroworld tour at Barclays I live close to Barclays and felt the same thing.
8,"I was laying dead still and alone, so it wasn't me :) I wondered if it might have been a small quake! Our whole house shook and it was loud like a truck hitting the house. I live in Armstrong and while laying in bed, felt move. The neighbours were outside looking, so it wasn t just us that heard it and felt it."
9,"May of been a frost quake this morning in Red Deer will continue to look into it. From my dad in #SylvanLake this morning: ""We may have had an earthquake here this morning. The result was a cold morning and plenty of shaking Oh dear lord hahahaha"
10,"Yes Yeah I just felt it too here in Alameda #BREAKING: M3.7 earthquake strikes near Piedmont, California, per @USGS. Just felt an #earthquake in San Francisco. @USGS says 3.7 M. Yep woke me up in Oakland (but had to verify on Twitter) Definitely."
11,"Wait aren't you the sake person Chris- yeah That s the only reason for the  indeed I was too  Everything is okay here, it was 4am and only a Magnitude 4 so not much happened. I missed it, I was asleep Indeed I was too. I hope everything gonna be ok??!!!"
12,"I thought I must've been dreaming, but something woke me up, and I thought it was the whole house shaking. That was the British political system falling over I just felt it too in Maryville TN Woke me up in Knoxville! I just felt it in ATL Felt it here too! I m in Asheville and felt it!"
13,I m sure the three people that died didn t think it was such  an awesome jolt  This is just distasteful That 'awesome jolt' also happened to kill at least three people... We just felt an awesome jolt of a 5.9 earthquake in #Osaka! My LA kids just had their first quake in Osaka :) Elissa s face says it all!
14,"I'm just visiting, I live on the coast of Maine & we barely got them haha u must be more used to this than me #iVoteBTSBBMAs @BTS_twt Yeah I m from Oakland. Haha yeah I m used to them but i always get scared/ panicky except for the super small ones like this one was kinda small but it was longer and it jolted . Y'all I'm so shook, I wonder if @BTS_twt felt it? My chair tipped over but I wasn't sitting on it #iVoteBTSBBMAs @BTS_twt Y all felt it too?"
15,Just felt an earthquake in LA while listening to @taylorswift13 s  Shake It Off ..
16,"Oh No Hope ye are all ok and safe We are in Washington said it was 5.3 in L A Epicenter of quake was in the ocean, off the coast, just south of the Channel Islands. Omg glad your ok There might be a few aftershocks... no worries. We just felt an Earthquake in Malibu a pretty strong shake ! We all ok !"
17,A 5.0 in the Channel Islands Looks like USGS updated it to a 5.3 Yeah I saw. I m over in Tarzana That was Mueller signing off on Trumps arrest warrant. I think it s good to have l tremors vs ? I took the screenshot before they updated it.
18,"I m in jersey so it ll take me at least 7 hours but for you I will lol I didn t feel anything but at the same time I ve been drinking so my whole world isn t balanced. No but I woke up from a dream here on the East Coast, in which there was an earthquake, about 3 hours ago. Me too  Yepp must have been cause I felt that in los feliz just now Felt it on the west side too. Creepy Nope, earthquake's loud noises can't wake me up but if someone whispers or if its really quite that might wake up."
19,"Only Raphael lol Do a fast-food video in cali please i swear you're my spirit animal Your a gif lol If you ever want to be sure only you can pull that off tho i started freaking out and ran outside in my underwear because i was one hundred percent sure i felt an earthquake, turns out my table is just uneven."
20,"Oakland I felt a brief movement in Tracy, at first I didn t think there was one until now. I woke up, thought I was dreaming then went back to sleep. However to me that didn t feel like a 4.4 if they ll like it was more than that but I m glad that it was only a 4.4 compared to others @NASAEarth @Quakeprediction (Fairfield). Yes my dog and I both were looking at each other like is it going to stop?? Yes here in @Vallejo - Yes that s what woke me up out of my deep sleep and still in motion @QuakesToday."

Just felt an earthquake in San Jose...Bed started shaking and door kept rattling. Didn t feel it in Houston, but now I feel *really* bad for leaving the cat home since his brother-from-another-mother died. On southwest expressway and fruitdale in San Jose."
23,"It s called damping, it allows for the vibrations from the ground to ripple upward through the building, if the building didn t sway there would be more structural damage. oh so that what it was i was so confused perfectly normal for a building to sway during an earthquake, it would be worse if it didn t Watch out for the aftershock Why?"
24,"First instinct was to check twitter if #earthquake was trending. I was happy my wall mounted bike didn't fall. Interesting Bot, never thought about how many earthquakes there are daily. LOL I was in a high rise and didn't feel a thing. Wasn't that strong (pictures stayed on the wall)."
25,"You can't tell a force of nature or a part of the earth to chill out, if the planet didn't have these quakes it would be a dead world. -- #California #Quakes nah...we're a sanctuary state now ...this is a rebellion so the state rebels Felt it here in Santa Cruz, too.

26,"I thought nothing happens in IL There is the new Madrid fault. Reports of an 3.8 M earthquake near Albion, IL just before 8 am. It is long overdue for a 8.0+ We have been preparing for it my entire life."
27,"I believe I have a power bar around here somewhere...should we buy Berkey's? I just felt an earthquake in LA. I felt it in Hollywood Hills. Prob an earthquake, Or.... maybe It's our unchecked rage over Trumpcare 3.0 rising to the surface in a quiet moment. Either that or I drank too much coffee this afternoon. Will stick with the britta but really feel like squashing fear with unnecessary purchases."

I bought $twtr stock for an emotional reason and thats on me and not you That was Snapchats share price No. no that was Benchmark v Kalanick You are just feeling the fallout of the $snap conference call and ER.. nothing to see here."
