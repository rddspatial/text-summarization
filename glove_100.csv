Conv_ID,Summary
1,Building is shaking here in Tokyo!! hey man. I am feeling an earthquake !!!!!! It's scary when u experience it for the 1st few times!
2,"My first reaction:  I need to save on Google docs that paper I have been editing all day  #priorities Just as I was reading about natural disasters, we felt a small #earthquake in Oakland. Always good to be prepared with five days worth of drinking water, spare everything and healthy snacks, first aid, etc."
3,"For the people that live in Orlando,Florida.... apparently there was an earthquake in Florida and I didn t feel it.. did you guys feel it? It s really REALLY rare to have an earthquake in Florida so that s why I m asking if you guys felt it Yes, I felt it. Didn't feel it, but heard a sliding glass door shake."
4,I missed this. Apparently some people in central Florida felt shaking like an earthquake today?
5,"I realize it isn't really weather related, but about 2 hours ago our house shook really hard for about 5 seconds (I'm on the barrier island) and it was felt in Orlando. No one is saying what it is and we all felt it on the island from Cocoa Beach down to Indialantic and over to Orlando. I only ask because I did not specifically feel the ground shake. House and it was felt the same over an hour away. Don't think that's air pressure."
6,"Yes, I felt it. Weird."
7,My roommate and I thought we felt an earthquake tonight and through this weird website I found two other people who felt it and turns out we live in the same neighborhood and the working theory is @trvisXX s astroworld tour at Barclays I live close to Barclays and felt the same thing. The rage is real
8,"I was laying dead still and alone, so it wasn't me :) I wondered if it might have been a small quake! The neighbours were outside looking, so it wasn t just us that heard it and felt it. I live in Armstrong and while laying in bed, felt move. Hi Anne. Widespread."
9,"From my dad in #SylvanLake this morning: ""We may have had an earthquake here this morning. May of been a frost quake this morning in Red Deer will continue to look into it. Power on now but everyone in town is freaking out. Felt out to Lacombe, and east of Red Deer."" Yes lots of peeps saying they felt it at 5:55am."
10,"Felt it in San Francisco. Yep woke me up in Oakland (but had to verify on Twitter) Yeah I just felt it too here in Alameda Yup. Definitely. Felt the quake in Walnut Creek, California."
11,"Hope everything is ok??!! Wishing you a very enjoyable Christmas Susan! I hope everything gonna be ok??!! Everything is okay here, it was 4am and only a Magnitude 4 so not much happened. Wait aren't you the sake person Chris-"
12,"Felt it here too! Woke me up in Knoxville! I thought I must've been dreaming, but something woke me up, and I thought it was the whole house shaking. I m in Asheville and felt it! I just felt it too in Maryville TN Glad to know I'm not crazy! I just felt it in ATL"
13,I m sure the three people that died didn t think it was such  an awesome jolt  This is just distasteful Glad you are all okay...I hate it when that happens(former Alaskan). Being originally from Southern California this brought back some  interesting  memories! That 'awesome jolt' also happened to kill at least three people... Elissa s face says it all! My LA kids just had their first quake in Osaka :)
14,"Thought it was just me... Y'all I'm so shook, I wonder if @BTS_twt felt it? I'm just visiting, I live on the coast of Maine & we barely got them haha u must be more used to this than me #iVoteBTSBBMAs @BTS_twt I hope not but oof is it just me?? omfg I just felt an earthquake in LA!!! Haha yeah I m used to them but i always get scared/ panicky except for the super small ones like this one was kinda small but it was longer and it jolted . Y all felt it too?"
15,Hope you're ok though Just felt an earthquake in LA while listening to @taylorswift13 s  Shake It Off ..
16,"Looking for news of where it was ? Felt it here in Lynwood, scary!! We're all safe. Yes, off the Channel Islands. There might be a few aftershocks... no worries. We just felt an Earthquake in Malibu a pretty strong shake ! Ventura County."
17,Heard it was a 5.3 from Channel Islands? I took the screenshot before they updated it. literally just tweeted the same thing. That was the Trump train breaking down. Looks like USGS updated it to a 5.3 Me too.
18,"Nope, earthquake's loud noises can't wake me up but if someone whispers or if its really quite that might wake up. I m in jersey so it ll take me at least 7 hours but for you I will lol Did anyone else in LA feel something just now that felt like an earthquake? I didn t feel anything but at the same time I ve been drinking so my whole world isn t balanced. No but I woke up from a dream here on the East Coast, in which there was an earthquake, about 3 hours ago. Figured it was that or a raging all star weekend party down the street. If not I ll go over."
19,"u make me laugh and ur a cutie so it's a win win for me. i'm in california atm and i was editing a video. i started freaking out and ran outside in my underwear because i was one hundred percent sure i felt an earthquake, turns out my table is just uneven. only you can pull that off tho If you ever want to be sure"
20,"Yes here in @Vallejo - Yes that s what woke me up out of my deep sleep and still in motion @QuakesToday. Woke me up. felt it in Mill Valley ! However to me that didn t feel like a 4.4 if they ll like it was more than that but I m glad that it was only a 4.4 compared to others @NASAEarth @Quakeprediction I felt a brief movement in Tracy, at first I didn t think there was one until now. Yes my dog and I both were looking at each other like is it going to stop? Anybody else, #BayArea?"
21,"Felt it in Alameda, strong ! #Earthquake felt in Burlingame, just woke us up at 2:40AM Breaking-I just felt an earthquake from my home in east bay. Same here in the Castro. Definitely felt it, too. Felt like a shake and not like a wave."
22,"Didn t feel it in Houston, but now I feel *really* bad for leaving the cat home since his brother-from-another-mother died. Didn t feel that one but felt the one we had yesterday in San Martin. Felt and heard it in San Jose! Man, haven t felt one in awhile. Yup same here . Though someone was going to knock down the door. Just felt an earthquake in San Jose...Bed started shaking and door kept rattling."
23,"perfectly normal for a building to sway during an earthquake, it would be worse if it didn t oh so that what it was i was so confused Wow just felt an earthquake in Korea, was super scary considering I'm 20 stories up. It s called damping, it allows for the vibrations from the ground to ripple upward through the building, if the building didn t sway there would be more structural damage."
24,"I was in a high rise and didn't feel a thing. omg i would have done the same....we have lost it!! Wasn't that strong (pictures stayed on the wall). I was happy my wall mounted bike didn't fall. Short but things were moving about. Interesting Bot, never thought about how many earthquakes there are daily."
25,"You can't tell a force of nature or a part of the earth to chill out, if the planet didn't have these quakes it would be a dead world. Felt it here in Santa Cruz, too. That was my thought too. But it didn't feel small! nah...we're a sanctuary state now ...this is a rebellion so the state rebels California, chill the fuck out plz. Jerry Brown...its your state..just democrats ."
26,It is long overdue for a 8.0+ We have been preparing for it my entire life. This one is thanks to fracking. Man made ones don't get much attention. There is the new Madrid fault. Is that fault common to give a jolt?
27,"Shook us up in Los Feliz, too. I felt it in Hollywood Hills. Prob an earthquake, Or.... maybe It's our unchecked rage over Trumpcare 3.0 rising to the surface in a quiet moment. I believe I have a power bar around here somewhere...should we buy Berkey's? Either that or I drank too much coffee this afternoon. There ya have it. Oh God."
28,Felt it in North San Jose... Not everyone in our building felt it. First one in a long time. We felt another one just a couple of minutes ago. My mom also felt it as I was speaking on phone with her. It was pretty quick here too. In West San Jose and didn't feel it... Sharp.
29,"I bought $twtr stock for an emotional reason and thats on me and not you Don't get emotional about stock, so says Gordon Gekko. You are just feeling the fallout of the $snap conference call and ER.. nothing to see here. Nope. No. This happened last time in our earthquake."
30,"Sure your sis already filled you in but it was crazy here. How big was it? Though, we can't guarantee that it's not... :) So glad that other people felt it too and that my room isn't possessed Hit near Lincoln, so that makes sense. Did you get any sleep? Anyone know?"
31,"ru sure it wasn't just the latest moto gp Ducati passing by? Like when you win the TT! imagine us fans have to go through in the hedges at the tt when you zip past at full throttle. come to Chile man. Strange feeling, unbelievable the power of nature!

I ve lived in the Bay Area for most of 60 years and still get nervous when there is an earthquake. Woke up from a jolt and a few seconds of shaking in #PleasantHill. Still a bit nervous even though it s my second quake. It was quite a strong quake (thought it was around a 5.5 magnitude) in years but not as strong like  the October 17, 1989 earthquake. This was more of a rattle compared to the wave I felt from Napa in 2014."

Only because we were outside already and out of danger"

199,"(I only felt Friday's because the other two were during work hours.) Today my house had its third earthquake in five days, this one a 3.3. My theory is that lots of little ones is a good thing - reducing the pressure little by little. I haven't felt anything down in SJ though."
