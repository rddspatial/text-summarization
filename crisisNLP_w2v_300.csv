Conv_ID,Summary
1,yeah man reminds me of earthquake in Sabah not long ago. It's scary when u experience it for the 1st few times! I am feeling an earthquake !!!!!!
2,"Always good to be prepared with five days worth of drinking water, spare everything and healthy snacks, first aid, etc. My first reaction:  I need to save on Google docs that paper I have been editing all day  #priorities Just as I was reading about natural disasters, we felt a small #earthquake in Oakland."
3,"It s really REALLY rare to have an earthquake in Florida so that s why I m asking if you guys felt it For the people that live in Orlando,Florida.... apparently there was an earthquake in Florida and I didn t feel it.. did you guys feel it? Was definitely an earthquake Yep live in Orlando florida usgs is clearly lying."
4,Apparently some people in central Florida felt shaking like an earthquake today? I missed this.
5,"I realize it isn't really weather related, but about 2 hours ago our house shook really hard for about 5 seconds (I'm on the barrier island) and it was felt in Orlando. No one is saying what it is and we all felt it on the island from Cocoa Beach down to Indialantic and over to Orlando. I only ask because I did not specifically feel the ground shake. A change in air pressure could shake a building. House and it was felt the same over an hour away."
6,"Yes, I felt it. I m pretty sure I felt an earthquake in central Florida this evening."
7,My roommate and I thought we felt an earthquake tonight and through this weird website I found two other people who felt it and turns out we live in the same neighborhood and the working theory is @trvisXX s astroworld tour at Barclays I live close to Barclays and felt the same thing. The rage is real
8,"I was laying dead still and alone, so it wasn't me :) I wondered if it might have been a small quake! The neighbours were outside looking, so it wasn t just us that heard it and felt it. I live in Armstrong and while laying in bed, felt move. Our whole house shook and it was loud like a truck hitting the house. Did anyone else just feel an earthquake in Salmon Arm?"
9,"Yes lots of peeps saying they felt it at 5:55am. From my dad in #SylvanLake this morning: ""We may have had an earthquake here this morning. May of been a frost quake this morning in Red Deer will continue to look into it. The result was a cold morning and plenty of shaking Power on now but everyone in town is freaking out."
10,"Just felt an #earthquake in San Francisco. Yeah I just felt it too here in Alameda #BREAKING: M3.7 earthquake strikes near Piedmont, California, per @USGS. Did anyone else feel it? Kinda scary @USGS says 3.7 M."
11,"Everything is okay here, it was 4am and only a Magnitude 4 so not much happened. I hope everything gonna be ok??!! yeah Hope everything is ok??!! That s the only reason for the  indeed I was too"
12,"I thought I must've been dreaming, but something woke me up, and I thought it was the whole house shaking. My mother used to say that you could feel them from time to time up that way. I just felt it in ATL I m in Asheville and felt it! I just felt it too in Maryville TN Up feeding the baby and just felt an earthquake. I felt it shake."
13,That 'awesome jolt' also happened to kill at least three people... I hope you guys never feel scare this morning... I m sure the three people that died didn t think it was such  an awesome jolt  This is just distasteful So 99% of Japanese buildings are still safety for huge earthquakes. Glad you are all okay...I hate it when that happens(former Alaskan). Being originally from Southern California this brought back some  interesting  memories!
14,"omfg I just felt an earthquake in LA!!! I'm just visiting, I live on the coast of Maine & we barely got them haha u must be more used to this than me #iVoteBTSBBMAs @BTS_twt Haha yeah I m used to them but i always get scared/ panicky except for the super small ones like this one was kinda small but it was longer and it jolted . Y'all I'm so shook, I wonder if @BTS_twt felt it? Oo wow It was a small one, just a rumble haha. Y all felt it too?"
15,Hope you're ok though Just felt an earthquake in LA while listening to @taylorswift13 s  Shake It Off ..
16,Oh No Hope ye are all ok and safe Pleased to hear your ok Roma. Omg glad your ok We just felt an Earthquake in Malibu a pretty strong shake ! We all ok ! Looking for news of where it was ? There might be a few aftershocks... no worries.
17,Looks like USGS updated it to a 5.3 That was the Trump train breaking down. I think it s good to have l tremors vs ? I took the screenshot before they updated it. literally just tweeted the same thing. Yeah I saw.
18,"Nope, earthquake's loud noises can't wake me up but if someone whispers or if its really quite that might wake up. Did anyone else in LA feel something just now that felt like an earthquake? I m in jersey so it ll take me at least 7 hours but for you I will lol I didn t feel anything but at the same time I ve been drinking so my whole world isn t balanced. Let me know if you re okay. No but I woke up from a dream here on the East Coast, in which there was an earthquake, about 3 hours ago. Yepp must have been cause I felt that in los feliz just now"
19,"Only Raphael lol i started freaking out and ran outside in my underwear because i was one hundred percent sure i felt an earthquake, turns out my table is just uneven. If you ever want to be sure u make me laugh and ur a cutie so it's a win win for me. Do a fast-food video in cali please"
20,"I felt a brief movement in Tracy, at first I didn t think there was one until now. I woke up, thought I was dreaming then went back to sleep. However to me that didn t feel like a 4.4 if they ll like it was more than that but I m glad that it was only a 4.4 compared to others @NASAEarth @Quakeprediction Yes my dog and I both were looking at each other like is it going to stop? Yes here in @Vallejo - Yes that s what woke me up out of my deep sleep and still in motion @QuakesToday. Just felt an #earthquake roll through in #SF! felt it in Mill Valley !"
21,"#Earthquake felt in Burlingame, just woke us up at 2:40AM It was pretty strong shit woke me up and i was high asleep Breaking-I just felt an earthquake from my home in east bay. Definitely felt it, too. My whole house just shook! Felt like a shake and not like a wave."
22,"Didn t feel that one but felt the one we had yesterday in San Martin. Man, haven t felt one in awhile. Didn t feel it in Houston, but now I feel *really* bad for leaving the cat home since his brother-from-another-mother died. Just felt an earthquake in San Jose...Bed started shaking and door kept rattling. Though someone was going to knock down the door. Sitter will give him extra loves and snuggles today. Bed moved and front door shook."
23,"perfectly normal for a building to sway during an earthquake, it would be worse if it didn t Wow just felt an earthquake in Korea, was super scary considering I'm 20 stories up. It s called damping, it allows for the vibrations from the ground to ripple upward through the building, if the building didn t sway there would be more structural damage. oh so that what it was i was so confused"
24,"It was a good one. First instinct was to check twitter if #earthquake was trending. Interesting Bot, never thought about how many earthquakes there are daily. Wasn't that strong (pictures stayed on the wall). omg i would have done the same....we have lost it!! I was in a high rise and didn't feel a thing."
25,"You can't tell a force of nature or a part of the earth to chill out, if the planet didn't have these quakes it would be a dead world. Ya'll are going down And seemed to last longer than 2 seconds. I felt it too! But it didn't feel small! Small shake, lasted two seconds max. Just felt a jolt at 8:17PM near Petaluma."
26,Is that fault common to give a jolt? It is long overdue for a 8.0+ We have been preparing for it my entire life. This one is thanks to fracking. There is the new Madrid fault. I thought nothing happens in IL
27,"Prob an earthquake, Or.... maybe It's our unchecked rage over Trumpcare 3.0 rising to the surface in a quiet moment. That felt very jolt-y. I felt it in Hollywood Hills. Boy, that sure jolts you up, huh? I believe I have a power bar around here somewhere...should we buy Berkey's? Either that or I drank too much coffee this afternoon. I just felt an earthquake in LA."
28,We felt another one just a couple of minutes ago. Not everyone in our building felt it. My mom also felt it as I was speaking on phone with her. Who felt that? We felt it! First one in a long time. Just felt an #earthquake in East San Jose. Just a little shaking.
29,"Don't get emotional about stock, so says Gordon Gekko. You are just feeling the fallout of the $snap conference call and ER.. nothing to see here. I bought $twtr stock for an emotional reason and thats on me and not you This happened last time in our earthquake. I apologize @jack im just not a good loser. Think I just felt an earthquake in SF?"
30,"So glad that other people felt it too and that my room isn't possessed Anyone know? Sure your sis already filled you in but it was crazy here. Hit near Lincoln, so that makes sense. Yeah, sounds crazy! Did you get any sleep? We have pendant lights that were swaying back and forth 2' every which way"
